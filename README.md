Solutions to the coding challenges
[FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.com) is an excellent project and @QuincyLarson has done a great job.
I decided to upload my solutions to github after i lost all my progress due to an unresolved loss of my entire progress.
They are here for personal/historical/reference/backup reasons.
The solutions i provide are probably the quickest and definitely not the most advanced or even optimised ones.
